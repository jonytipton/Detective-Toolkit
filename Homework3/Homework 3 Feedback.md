## Extras

20 - Great sketches and logo! Love the additional info you included for each section. As for the age rating, I don't believe people look at that too much when deciding to download it, unless the content is questionable, then they'll check. People mostly go off of screenshots in general but also to see if it would be age appropriate for their child.
