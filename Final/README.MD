### Summary:
Multi-purpose "Detective Toolkit" that allows users to create to-do lists (utilizes Core Data and Image Picker via Camera or photo library), browse the web (via google or with full URL to type in address bar via webkit/webview), "hide" user's appearance using an ARScene with ARKit, and recognize images taken with the camera or saved in the photo library (utilizes CoreML and the Resnet50 machine learning model).

### Build:
Download Resnet50 ZIP, DetectiveToolkit.xcodeproj, and the DetectiveToolkit folder into the same directory. Unzip Resnet50.zip. Build app and run with simulator or via connected iOS device. Camera buttons in Tasks and Identiy tabs will crash if using simulator.

### Discussion:
Updates for this project...
Added ARScene and replaced the Mapkit view to better fit with the theme of the app. Determined this app could be geared towards children as a "detective" toolkit app that allows users to take notes, research topics, identify unknown objects, and interact with augmented reality masks to put on a "disguise".
