# Project 1 Feedback



## Requirements:

You app, at a minimum must have the following requirements in order to achieve the base score.

1. Implement a location manager and use those coordinates in a visible-to-the-user way.
2. Implement the ability to add images (UIImageView) from the camera **and** photo library.
3. UI requirements
   1. UITableView with dynamic data
   2. Complex UIView (ex: MKMapView, UICollectionView, etc)



## Base Score

5/5 = 80%



## Extras

20 - ToDo list, webview, ML Kit. Didn't see a "visible-to-the-user" result of the user's location on the Targets tab. ML recognition works pretty well.



# Final Score

80 + 20 = 100%
